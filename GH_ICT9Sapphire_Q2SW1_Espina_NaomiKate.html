			<td class="Bg1">They are very loyal and smart and make wonderful companions. Distinctive features include their pure white coat that has a mane-like feature about their neck. Also, like other spitz breeds, their tails curl over their back in a beautiful hair plume. A pointed muzzle likens them to a fox with a black nose, black eye rims, and ears of pointed triangles, which stand erect and move like radar towers, hearing everything going on around them and making this breed very alert.<br><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/japanese-spitz/">Reference</a></td>

			<td class="Bg1"> Pekingese are compact, stocky toy dogs weighing up to 14 pounds. The coat is longest at the neck and shoulders, giving Pekes their famous 'lion's mane.'Coats come in various reds, from a golden-red to darker shades. The large, short-muzzled head is a wider-than-long 'envelope shaped' rectangle, and the eyes are large, dark, and sparkly. <br><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pekingese/">Reference</a></td>
